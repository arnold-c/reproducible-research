# Welcome, and what this book is about

This bookâ€™s focus is on how to produce reproducible research, and should serve as an introduction to data management and project organisation. Through the course of this document, we explain techniques that can be employed easily to help add structure to your research projects and reduce the time spent poring over code to determine if your code really does produce the table and figures you have in your manuscript or poster. Not only does this aid you, but it is essential if the project moves between people. We also hope that the structures we suggest will help you find documents and files more easily.

Whilst there are many tools that we can use to ensure our projects and code are tidy and result in reproducible work, some of these may not possible to implement given the potential requirements for administrative privileges during set up. As such, we have divided this book into multiple sections, progressively getting more involved as the book continues. Whilst you may be able to utilise these more sophisticated tools, the core of reproducible research remains the same, so the first chapters still apply.

We start by explaining what reproducible research is, why we need it, and how the data we receive can be integrated into a reproducible research workflow. Next, we suggest ways in which you can structure projects to assist this workflow. We end by discussing how to create a Jupyter Notebook and produce the output documents, allowing you to integrate your code and results in a dynamic document.

We hope that you enjoy the content and feel like you come away having learnt something useful, and that this book can serve as a reference document for your future research. If you have any questions that cannot be answered within the book, or you would like to contribute and improve this document, please contact us.

This document would not be possible without the contributions of Stephanie Hughes from Public Health Ontario, so thank you Steph!
